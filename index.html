    <h1 class="title">What exactly is bubble tea?</h1>
    <p>Bubble Tea is Taiwanese cold drink made with tea, sweetened milk or other flavorings, and balls or "pearls" of tapioca.</p>
    <h2 class="title">History</h1>
    <p>Boba, or bubble tea, originated in Taiwan in the early 1980s, with two tea houses, Hanlin Tea Room and Chun Shui Tang, claiming to be its creator. Hanlin Tea Room reportedly added white tapioca balls to tea, while Chun Shui Tang's product development manager, Lin Hsiu Hui, is said to have combined sweetened tapioca pudding with tea. The drink's popularity spread throughout Asia in the 1990s and to the West shortly after. </p>
